##Angular-PDF is an OPEN Open Source Project

> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
- **External API changes and significant modifications** should be subject to a **pull request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
- Pull requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
- Use a non-`master` branch for ongoing work.
- Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.
- Run `npm test` locally before submitting your PR to catch easy-to-miss style & testing issues
