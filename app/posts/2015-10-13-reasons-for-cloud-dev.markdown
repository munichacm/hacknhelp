* **Improve your skills.** There are no such a lot of events for cloud developers in our country. And it’s more rare case when we can meet such amazing [speakers](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/#!/speakers). You can ask any question, learn new useful information from leaders in Cloud computing and of course get endless inspiration for self-improvement. Even more - we have great [workshop](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/#!/speakers/19) on Firebase topic. So you won’t stop only on theory - practical experience will be a great bonus. Just don’t forget to bring your own computer for the workshop. 

* **Meet the community.** Don’t miss a great chance of getting to know people who like Cloud platforms. You’ll find people who share your opinions about technologies, hobbies, life in general. So even coffee breaks between lectures will be useful - you can find new friends, colleagues and probably your future partners!

* **Create community.** Who said that you need only take information? We are sure that you have unique set of technical wisdom and can share it with anybody. Try to show people something new - you’ll find not only positive feedback but also some support, useful critics and new ideas. And then… become our speaker next year! We love that great atmosphere on DevFest when technologies rule the world!
