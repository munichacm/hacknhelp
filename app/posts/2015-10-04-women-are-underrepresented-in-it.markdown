Our friends from the [Netherlands](http://www.devfest.nl/) touched important theme in their [blog](http://www.devfest.nl/blog/) about **gender diversity why women are underrepresented in IT**. The cause of this seems to resonate with the lack of diversity in academia and the workplace. Take Ukraine, only 10% of students studying computer science in recent years  at a professional level are women. While the past 100 years has seen tremendous progress, and overt, intentional discrimination is not often an issue, girls and boys still grow up with very different roles,treated differently from infancy by parents and teachers,having vastly different expectations in many religions, and shown different sets of acceptable toys within toy stores. These differences have a profound influence on females’ career paths.

While opinions may vary, there are a few different reasons why we and others think that gender diversity is important:
 * Diversity of thought and essential skills, as women bring different perspectives and knowledge. There is a pool of talent with experience and expertise that has remained almost untapped.
 * Changing the perception of which interests males and females are expected to have addresses a much larger problem of the mismatch between equal levels of capability and achievement in math and science, and the very different career choices men and women make. Research has shown that parents provide boys and girls with different experiences through the toys they receive and the ways in which praise is given.
 * Encouraging role models to show that computer scientists can put their skills to the greater good can encourage adolescent females to consider it as a field that has a large societal impact. It has been shown that this demographic leans towards biological and medical sciences for this very reason.
 * Females tend to have higher social intelligence, working better in teams and leading teams than their male colleagues.

In practice, better balanced product teams tend to produce products with a competitive edge that are suited to a larger portion of the population.

A more detailed explanation about the diversity of experiences, ideas, and social intelligence, and a detailed response to various criticisms of positive discrimination is addressed in A Practical Guide to Gender Diversity for Computer Science Faculty, in chapter 2, [Why is Gender Diversity Important? (PDF)](http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/CMSC304/Fall2014/PracticalGuideGenderDiversity-Ch2.pdf).

### What can we do to help?

We believe that a primary cause is perception. A vicious cycle occurs when a gender gap forms, where one group perceives a particular profession as unfavorable. We’ve seen the number of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) on a steady decline since the mid-1980s, and the problem couldn’t become much worse before hitting absolute zero.

As a sizable event in technology, we found it in part our responsibility to encourage diversity at GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015. We’ve taken three distinct approaches:
 * Providing women an extra opportunity to obtain much wanted tickets to increase female attendance **(the promo code for 18% off  is - WTMPROMO18)**;
 * Arranging for WTM Ukraine members to address this topic during their speeches in Community track or  the afternoon break;
 * Encouraging women to speak up and be role models to inspire others.

### What can you do to help?
Please be welcoming of diversity! Encourage friends and colleagues to join in community events. By involving women in developer communities we can begin to change the perception of our industry.

**And to women: speak up!** Get involved with events like **DevFest** by submitting an abstract of a topic that you’re passionate about, or volunteer to participate in organizing community events like these. As Chiu-Ki Chan writes in her blog post about Droidcon NYC, [there’s no excuse not to](http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/08/droidcon-nyc-22-percent-female-speakers.html).
