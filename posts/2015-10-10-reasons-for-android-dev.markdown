This year we’ll have the biggest GDG DevFest comparing to all previous years. We are growing and developing our communities in Ukraine but also creating more and more communications with GDG chapters all over the world. No wonder that [less than 100 tickets left](http://2event.com/events/312113). But if you, android developer, still have any doubts, just look at **3 main reasons** to visit the event.

* **Meet [Google Developer Experts](https://developers.google.com/experts/all/technology/android)**. Of course you’ll get priceless knowledge and some cool developing experience during the [workshops](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/#!/blog/workshops-announced). But also you can ask Experts anything! Have they ever failed? Or maybe they have changed preferred technology? Think, how many interesting questions you can ask. Even more - you can directly ask how to [become the next expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/become-an-expert). BTW, year ago we didn’t have GDEs in Ukraine and now we have 2 Ukrainian Experts! And it’s only the beginning.

* **Devices expo**. We promise that you haven’t seen such great collection for a long time! Of course you have your own gadgets and some devices on your workplace for testing. But how many of them can you access right now? You know evolution of [Android OS](https://www.android.com/history/#/marshmallow) but do you remember evolutional way of Android smartphones and tablets? We’ll show you. One more thing - you’ll have a chance to participate in [Expeditions demo](https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/). It will be legendary.

* **Atmosphere**. Everybody knows that it’s cool to see speakers from such companies as Google, Intel, Yandex etc. It’s great to get new skills from workshops. But the most important part of such event is its audience.  As we mentioned in press releases we won’t have any marketing bullshit during the conference. And it’s completely true!  You can share your ideas, find co-workers and even get inspiration to start GDG Community in your own city [if it doesn’t have yet](https://developers.google.com/groups/directory/Ukraine) (it’s real case from #DFUA 2014 =)) You can create this magic by yourself. THINK OUT OF THE BOX. CREATE WHAT YOU WANT!
