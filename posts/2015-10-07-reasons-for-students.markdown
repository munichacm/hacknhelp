### **To meet people**
A big reason for going to DFUA is to meet and meet up with people. The conference brings together people from all different geographical areas who share a knowledge, and is a great way to meet new people in your field. At a [GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/) you will be able to get together with people from a wide range of backgrounds.

### **For people to meet you**
It may not seem like a notable thing, but DFUA is also a good way for people to meet you. Yes, you, the lowly second year grad student, presenting for the first time. You may meet someone at a meal, and within a few minutes, you can make a connection with someone that you might not even have met if you hadn’t attended the conference. This is especially important when you are looking for collaborators, or jobs and postdocs.The festival is another way to get your name and your work out there as you begin to establish yourself in your field of study.

### **To present your work to others**
This is one of the more obvious reasons for attending the festival: to present your work! It’s good practice in talking about what you do with a variety of people from similar, related and/or completely different areas of IT. At the conference you have the opportunity to get feedback on your work from people who have never seen it before and may provide new insight.

### **To learn new things in your field**
As attend different talks, you hear a lot about things in your field that may be new to you. These could be new techniques, data that is yet unpublished, or investigators that you may not have heard of. In addition, GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015 gives you the opportunity to talk to these people one-on-one about what they are working on, and they may even give you advice on how to develop your project. You have the opportunity to ask presenters questions about their work and the rationale behind it, which you can’t do when reading journal articles!

### **To learn new things outside of your field**
This is a two-fold benefit of going to [GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/), since not only may you learn things outside your field about other areas of IT, but DevFest also have many sessions for professional development and community colloborations. Moreover, [GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/) will arrange several professional development workshops, where you can get new knowledge and practice yourself.

**So why go to [GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/)?** I guess a short summary reason would be: **for your continued personal and professional development.** Take advantage of this opportunity. **Meet people. Network. Learn new things.** Who knows, you may even end up leaving a conference with a job offer!
