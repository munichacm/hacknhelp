If you, web developer, think there is no place for you at  [DFUA](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/), you are deeply mistaken, because then you may be missing out on one of the best opportunities to take your game to the next level!

### Sharpen the Saw
You have the greates opportunities to hear more about web-technologies as [Angular](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/?utm_content=buffer9c658&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer#!/speakers/22), try Polymer on [workshop](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/?utm_content=buffer9c658&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer#!/speakers/15), find out more about Material Design on [speech](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/?utm_content=buffer9c658&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer#!/speakers/1). But the main idea of this reason is that sometimes you have to take a break from the “work” of your work to sharpen your skills. A dull axe won’t cut a tree nearly as effectively as a sharp one. Don’t be the woodcutter hacking away at the tree with a dull axe while your competition cuts it down in half the time with a sharp one :)

### Meet Experts & Influencers Face to Face
While not all conferences offer you the opportunity to meet your IT idols, your chances are greatly improved when you’re sharing the same space. And anyway, you can get a chance to talk face-to-face with [Web-experts](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/#!/speakers) at DFUA with whom you can share your ideas and get priceless advices, or just take a selfie :)

### Networking Opportunities
[GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/) gives opportunities for attendees to mix and mingle, form new relationships, and strengthen existing ones. Over coffee, lunch, or cocktails, you may make a connection with the perfect provider or prospect. At a breakout session you may find the same web-developers as you and associates.

### Break Out of Your Comfort Zone
Such live event as [DFUA](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/) force you to break out of your comfort zone. 
It’s easy to read a blog post from the privacy of your own office. You won’t break a sweat listening to a podcast (unless you’re on the treadmill.) You don’t have to make small talk while your YouTube video loads up. 
While there are those among us who are born networkers, for many of us live events, and other people, can be a challenge. But breaking out of our comfort zones is just the type of action we need to take to break out of old ways of thinking that have got us in a rut in our jobs.

### Have Fun!
DFUA is  fun! You can make  amazing connections and even more amazing friends from going to [GDG DevFest Ukraine 2015](http://devfest.gdg.org.ua/). Don’t miss out on these opportunities!
