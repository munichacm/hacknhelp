aboutUs: "The Carpenter Lab is based at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Our research group develops advanced methods and software tools to quantify and mine the rich information present in cellular images to yield biological discoveries. Our laboratory is best known for our open source software packages CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst, but our main focus these days is profiling: we are using advanced machine learning methods to identify morphological patterns in cell populations, to probe the causes and cures for disease."
